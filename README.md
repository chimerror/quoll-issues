# Quoll Issues Repository

[Quoll](https://quoll-alpha.netlify.app/) is the code name for a reality programming text adventure that I am working on. Help Ada figure out how to use the mystical realm of Funge space to change the reality around her while still ensuring the premises are met. There will be twisty passages and grues!

While I wish to keep the actual code repository private, I also want to keep track of work and features publically, so I am creating this issues repository. As such, this repository will have no actual sorce code. (Don't worry, I'll make the source code repository public upon full release!)

If you wish to file an issue, I recommend using the TRANSCRIPT ON and TRANSCRIPT OFF commands to make a transcript of the game to attach to your issues, as well as using the Playerr Feedback feature to leave comments in the playthrough by starting your commands with common punctuation like "?" or "!".

You can also follow my progress on [the project Trello board](https://trello.com/b/2leWtZxb/quoll-project-board).
